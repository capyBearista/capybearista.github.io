  <p>
    I really wanted to use Obsidian to write documentation for my home server,
    but publishing it directly to GitHub Wiki doesn't quite work because of odd
    discrepancies between Obsidian's markdown syntax and GitHub's. This is a Git
    hook system that automatically transforms Obsidian's unique link syntax into
    GitHub Wiki format. It's as simple as writing your notes in Obsidian and
    committing them; the script automatically converts text to the correct
    format and pushes changes to the wiki!

  <h4>Key Features:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Automatic Link Conversion</strong> - Transforms Obsidian's
      `[[wikilink]]` syntax to GitHub Wiki format
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Git Integration</strong> - Seamlessly integrates with existing Git
      workflows through hooks
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Batch Processing</strong> - Efficiently handles multiple files and
      directory structures
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Error Handling</strong> - Robust error handling for various edge
      cases and syntax variations
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Bidirectional Sync</strong> - Future enhancement to sync changes
      from GitHub Wiki back to Obsidian
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    GitHub has an included "Wiki" feature, which lets each repository have its
    very own... wiki! I wanted to be able to write the pages using a note-taking
    application called Obsidian, but with GitHub's frankly odd proprietary
    flavor of Markdown, it was more complicated than just pushing the Markdown
    files. After a search that spanned way longer than it should have, I found,
    forked, and began developing this Python script! Using Git's post-commit
    hook, it converts notes written in Obsidian to a format that GitHub Wiki
    likes and uploads it automatically.It was a sort of arduous process, but
    well worth it. These are the steps I took:
  </p>

  <h4>Development Journey:</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Looking for an existing solution</strong> - I couldn't for the
        life of me find a community plugin or feature to handle this, until I
        came across a Reddit post by
        <a href="https://github.com/BjornFJohansson"
          >a professor from Portugal</a
        >
        talking about his experiment script. I navigated to the GitHub repo,
        installed the Git hook, and it was kind of magical, seeing my home
        server wiki written in Obsidian appear online.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Becoming a maintainer</strong> - I was a total newbie to GitHub.
        I made a couple pull requests to the repo, but nothing happened for a
        while. I ended up reaching out to Bj√∂rn via email, and after a while, I
        was able to become a maintainer!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Finalizing the Language</strong> - The original maintainer chose
        Python, and I can see why. It's got excellent string processing
        capabilities and extensive regex support. I ended up sticking with it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Writing the Core Algorithm</strong> - I ironed out the regex
        patterns and conversion logic to handle various markdown syntax
        differences. This was the most challenging part due to the complexity of
        edge cases. Regex has made me want to pull out my hair several times.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Git Integration & Troubleshooting</strong> - Git can be finicky,
        so there were a lot of strange errors here ü•≤.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Finishing!</strong> - Except there's always more work to be
        done. There's a chance this page will be outdated by the time you're
        reading it (check the GitHub repo to see the current state o the
        project).
