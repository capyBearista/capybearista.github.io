               <p>What does this script do? Well, GitHub has an included "Wifi" feature, which lets each repository have its very own... wiki! However, I wanted to be able to write the pages using something else, a note-taking application called Obsidian. So I started developing this Python script, which acts as a post-commit hook in Git. It essentially converts my notes writting in Obsidian to a format that GitHub Wiki likes and uploads it automatically. It was a sort of arduous process, but well worth it. These are the steps I took: </p>
               <ol>
                  <li><p><span class="bold">Identifying the best language to the program in. </span>I found Python to be pretty great for this. It's not too hard to learn.</p></li>
                  <li><p><span class="bold">Writing the bulk of the program. </span>The whole process was admittedly kind of confusing because regular expressions has never been my strong point...</p></li>
                  <li><p><span class="bold">Troubleshooting. </span>There were quite a lot of strange errors here and there! Git is finicky so this stage had plenty of hairpulling and looking things up on Google.</p></li>
                  <li><p><span class="bold">Finishing! </span>Except there's always more work to be done... For example, I want to make it so changes on GitHub Wiki are reflected in Obsidian.</p></li>
