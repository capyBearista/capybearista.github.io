**Last updated: August 1, 2025**

## Overview

Privacy is important. This privacy policy explains how I handle information when you visit my portfolio website at [capybearista.github.io](https://capybearista.github.io).

## Information Collection

This website uses **GoatCounter**, a privacy-respecting web analytics service, to understand how visitors use the site. GoatCounter is designed with privacy in mind and operates differently from traditional analytics services.

GoatCounter collects minimal, non-personal information including:
- Pages visited
- Referrer (where you came from)
- Browser and operating system (in general terms)
- Screen size
- Country (based on IP address, but IP addresses are not stored)

### What GoatCounter Does NOT Collect

- **No cookies** are set or used
- **No personal information** is collected
- **No IP addresses** are stored
- **No cross-site tracking**
- **No advertising profiles**
- **No selling of data**

## Data Storage

- All analytics data is processed by GoatCounter, which is GDPR compliant
- Data is stored in the European Union
- No personal identifiers are stored
- You can view the public analytics dashboard at any time

## Your Rights

Since no personal data is collected:
- There is no personal data to delete
- There are no cookies to disable
