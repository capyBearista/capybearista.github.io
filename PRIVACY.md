## Overview

This website respects your privacy. I believe in transparency about data collection and use minimal, privacy-respecting analytics to understand how the site is being used.

## Analytics

This site uses Plausible Analytics, a privacy-focused analytics service that I self-host. This means your data stays on my servers and is never shared with third parties.

### What Plausible Collects

- Page views and which pages you visit
- Referrer information (what site sent you here, if any)
- General location data (country/region level only, not specific location)
- Device type and browser information (general categories, not specific fingerprinting)
- Visit duration and bounce rate

### What Plausible Does NOT Collect

- No cookies are stored on your device
- No personal information or user identification
- No precise location data (GPS coordinates, etc.)
- No cross-site tracking
- No behavioral profiling
- No email addresses, names, or contact information

### Self-Hosted Analytics

I self-host my Plausible Analytics instance, which means:
- Your data never leaves my own server
- No data is shared with Plausible Analytics the company
- I have full control over data retention and privacy
- Analytics data is used solely to understand site usage patterns

## Cookies

This website does not use cookies for analytics or tracking purposes. The only cookies that may be set are technical cookies required for the website to function properly (like theme preferences stored in your browser's local storage).

## Third-Party Services

### Google Fonts
This site loads fonts from Google Fonts. Google may collect some information when fonts are loaded. You can review Google's privacy policy for more information about their data practices.

### External Links
This site contains links to external websites (like GitHub repositories). When you click these links, you leave this site and are subject to the privacy policies of those external sites.

## Data Retention

Analytics data is retained for a reasonable period to understand site usage trends, typically 12 months, after which it is automatically deleted.

## Your Rights

Since no personal data is collected, there are no specific data rights to exercise. However, if you prefer to browse without any analytics:
- You can use browser extensions that block analytics scripts
- You can disable JavaScript in your browser
- Most ad blockers automatically block analytics scripts
