  <p>Beyond the screen, I've got a couple hobbies I can talk about.</p>

  <h3>Photography</h3>
  <p>
    Landscape photography has been my main thing for the longest time, but I've
    recently been drawn to taking portraits because of the process. It's a
    collaboration. You're not just taking a picture. You're having a
    conversation, learning about someone, and working to bring out the qualities
    that make them who they are. More importantly, I just think people look cool

  <h3>Coffee Shop Discoveries</h3>
  <p>
    And on a smaller scale, this curiosity is what fuels my ongoing quest to
    find the best local coffee shop. I'm always exploring, looking for that
    perfect combination of great coffee and a great "vibe." Each stop is a small
    moment, but it's a chance to appreciate the unique character of a place.

  <h3>A Mysterious, Secret Third Thing??</h3>
  <p>
    I want to talk about my involvement in my community, because, well, I guess I try to make it more than just extracurriculars to put
    on a resume. I'm an advocate at heart. For me, things like student
    government are about building a stronger community and making sure every
    voice is heard. Sharing our wins, and losses too, together makes us stronger :D

  <h3>The Common Thread</h3>
  <p>
      Whether it's through a camera lens, in community meetings, or over a good cup of coffee, I'm always looking for those moments of genuine connection. These experiences shape how I approach everything else - including how I think about technology and the problems it should solve.
